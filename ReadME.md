<h3 align="center">What is this project?</h3>
<p align="center">This project is using JavaScript to build a translator for Morse Code and then back. I kept the Morse Code in an object so that I could use arrays to transform the string that is input and then use the object keys, to give the value. It used .map so that I can create an array and call a function to grab the key values.</p>

<br>
<h3 align="center">What I learned</h3>
<p align="center">I found this project useful for thinking about creating tests before creating the function so that I knew what I wanted the function to do. It was difficult to create the actual function, as I wasn't sure thr route to take. Although through some research and the training I recieved I worked out that using arrays would be the easiest for me. As it can be manipulated, and changed.</p>
